# py-package-installer
handy script and batch for people who need an elevated admin access batch to call python in cli. nice to hand over to those teammates who dont like CLI, but need some things done with elevated access.

> You can totally just use the .bat to request an elevated admin to run... whatever. maybe nrfjprog something ;)
